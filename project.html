	<h3>Grading</h3>
	<p>
	Only code that you implemented will be graded. Code that was graded in previous assignments will not be considered for grading in the final project. Code that was not written during the course, by the student submitting the project, will not be considered for grading and <em>must</em> be properly documented.
	</p>

	<h4> Proposal (10 Points) </h4>
	<p>
	Create an html document with a proposed motivational image. Describe with a few sentences how the image conforms with this year's theme. Provide a breakdown of features relevant to your image. Propose a valid subset of features that sums up to 90 points (see below for details).
	</p>

	<h4> Presentation & Report (10 Points) </h4>
	<p>
		Neatness and completeness of your oral presentation and your report will be graded.
	</p>


	<h4> Implementation (90 Points) </h4>
	<p>
	In your renderer you are required to implement a minimum set of features that will be showcased in your report for grading. Features/Functionality are split into 3 categories: simple, moderate and advanced. Your task is to submit in your report any combination of the following types of features that sums up to 90 points. <em>The only restriction is that you must implement at least 1 advanced feature</em>.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Simple features can get up to a maximum of 5 points each (e.g. Depth of Field) </li>
		<li> Moderate features can get up to a maximum of 15 points each  (e.g. Environment map emitter with importance sampling or Homogeneous Volumetric Path Tracing) </li>
		<li> Advanced features can get up to a maximum of 30 points (e.g. Irradiance Caching or Subsurface Scattering) </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	The above point breakdowns are just a rough guide. Its possible to e.g. implement a very sophisticated version of a simple algorithm and this would be worth more than a bare-bones version of the same method.
	Correctness and sufficient <em> validation </em> will highly impact the final grade. For instance, an untested and buggy implementation of an advanced feature such as irradiance caching may end up getting you less points than a very well tested, and sophisticated depth-of-field implementation.
	Each graded feature you point out in your report will be graded for completeness and correctness. In your report you should have:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li> Feature specific renderings showcasing a scene that emphasizes the feature's effect. </li>
		<li> Technical details of the implementation.</li>
		<li> <em>Validation tests</em> performed and their results.</li>
		<li> Code coordinates for the bulk of the feature's implementation. </li>
	</ul>

	We will not be giving out a list of approved features for each category, we leave this assignment up to you.
	For graded features that do not affect your renderings you must have a paragraph in your report with implementation details. 


	<h3>What to submit</h3>

	Your submission must contain:
		
	<ul>
		<li> The complete solution with all solution and source files, but NO binaries. </li>
		<li> An <tt>html</tt> file named <tt>report-firstname-lastname.html</tt> in the following format: 
		<p>
		Structure the document in sections where in each section you describe a graded feature of your renderer. In addition your document should start with a section showcasing your motivation image and end with a section showing your final submitted image. This document will be uploaded on the rendering competition website and will be publicly available.
		</p>
		<p>
		For every selected (graded) functonality/feature include a feature specific image(s) you generated (if applicable) in a format that is view-able within a web browser. The image(s) must convince us that the functionality is implemented correctly and completely. You can follow the validation paradigm we used in the homework. Also include descriptions of encountered problems, a list of external libraries that you used and other comments for each selected functionality. End with a summary section which briefly describes other functionality that was implemented but not submitted for grading.
		</p>
		</li>
		<li> An <tt>pptx</tt> or <tt>pdf</tt> file named <tt>presentation-firstname-lastname.pxx</tt> :
		<p> 
			This file will contain your 5 minute presentation that will be presented in front of the judges during the rendering competition. The structure of your presentation should follow these guidelines:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> An inspiring photograph and its relation to the theme. Point out the interesting phenomena in the image.</li>
			<li> Provide a brief overview of the functionality/features of your renderer.</li>
			<li> Point out technical details and challenges for a set of interesting features you have implemented.</li>
			<li> Presentation ends with your final image, your submission for the rendering competition.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li> Send your solution, report and presentation by e-mail. You can provide links to a website that contains your submission files. We recommend uploading your solution to your personal ETH website or another free file hosting service such as <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">dropbox</a> or <a href="http://onedrive.live.com">onedrive</a> <em>before</em> the submission deadline. Your presentation must exist as a <em>standalone file</em>, seperate from the solution and report. The students who will not be able to attend the competition can also provide a pre-recorded video of their presentation. </li>
	</ul>
