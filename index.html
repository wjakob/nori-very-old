					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>
						Nori 2 is a minimalistic ray tracer written in C++. It runs
						on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS and provides a foundation for
						the homework assignments in the course
						<a href="https://www.graphics.ethz.ch/teaching/imsynth15/home.php">Image Synthesis</a> taught at ETH Zürich.
					</p>
					<p>
						While Nori provides much support code to simplify your development 
						work as much as possible, the code that you will initially receive
						from us does very little: it loads a scene and saves a rendered image
						as an <span rel="tooltip" title="A popular high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEXR">OpenEXR</a></span> image&mdash;but
						the actual rendering code is missing, hence the output image just
						consists of black pixels.

						Your task will be to extend this system to a full-fledged physically-based 
						renderer as part of programming assignments and your final project.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="col-md-6" id="general">
					<h2>Core features</h2>
					The Nori base code provides many features that would be tedious
					to implement from scratch. The following are included:
					<ul>
						<li>A simple GUI to watch images as they render</li>
						<li>An XML-based scene file loader</li>
						<li>Basic point/vector/normal/ray/bounding box classes</li>
						<li>A pseudorandom number generator (<a href="http://www.pcg-random.org/">PCG32</a>)</li>
						<li>Support for saving output as <a href="http://www.openexr.com/">OpenEXR files</a></li>
						<li>A loader for Wavefront OBJ files</li>
						<li>An optimized <a href="Fast and Parallel Construction of SAH-based Bounding Volume Hierarchies">bounding volume hierarchy builder</a></li>
						<li>Ray-triangle intersection</li>
						<li>Code for multi-threaded rendering</li>
						<li>Image reconstruction filters</li>
						<li>Statistical \(\chi^2\)- and \(t\)-tests to verify sampling code</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Guidelines</h2>
					<h3>Permissible sources of information</h3>
					<p>
						Feel free to consult additional references
						when completing projects, but remember cite them in your writeup.
					</p>
					<p>
						When asked to implement feature \(X\), we request that you don't 
						go and read the source code of the implementation of \(X\) in some other renderer,
						because you will likely not learn much in the process. The PBRT book
						is <span rel="tooltip" title="Technically, this book contains the implementation of a renderer, but that's ok in this case.">excluded</span> from this rule.
						If in doubt, get in touch with the course staff.
					</p>

					<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>Note</b>: Undeclared copying of code or images (either from other students or from external sources) 
					is strictly prohibited! Any violation of this rule will lead to expulsion from the class. If you're ever in doubt, just include a citation in your code or report indicating where some idea came from, whether it be a web site, another piece of software, or anything—this always maintains your honesty, whether the source was used in a good way or not. When you turn your assignment in, you are claiming that everything in it is your original idea unless you cite a source for it.
					</div>

					 
					<p>
					Late submissions are subject to the grading scheme as discussed in the first lecture. The goal of these exercises is to help you create the foundation of a good renderer for subsequent assignments and the rendering competition.  It is your job to convince us that you have implemented the assignments correctly, through the information provided in your reports and the quality/readability of your code. We will deduct points for poorly written code or inconclusive comparisons/validations in your report. Make sure to start working on the homework as early as possible.  Building your own advanced renderer is a lot of fun. Use this great opportunity, and don’t forget to have fun!
					</p>

					<h3>What to submit?</h3>
					<p>
					The complete codebase with your solution and source files, but NO binaries. An html file named <tt> firstname-familyname-report.html</tt> using <a href=https://graphics.ethz.ch/teaching/imsynth15/downloads/resources/report-template.zip>this</a> template. Include the following:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li> Structure your report using the same numbers and titles as given in the assignment </li>
						<li> For every task include all task specific images you generated in a format that is viewable within a web browser. You can use HDRI Tools, or photoshop to tonemap you images and save them as jpgs or pngs. We recommend tonemapping your images by just changing exposure and using a gamma of 2.2. </li>
						<li> Include descriptions of encountered problems, a list of external libraries that you used and the time you spent on each task. </li>
					</ul>

					The task descriptions may contain more specific instructions on what has to be included.

					Send your solution or report problems to <tt>imagesynthesis_.AT._inf.ethz.ch</tt> with the subject <tt>paX-firstname-familyname</tt>. Use the same name for your zip files. Password protect your zip file with the password <tt>is</tt> to prevent ETH mail virus protection problems.

					<h3>Comments</h3>
					<p>
					We would appreciate any comments or criticism to improve the
					projects in future years. This section of the overview document will not be graded.
					Examples of information that is useful to us includes:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How much time did you spend on the assignment? How was it divided between designing, coding, and testing?</li>
						<li>What advice should we have given you before you started?</li>
						<li>What was hard or surprising about the assignment?</li>
						<li>What did you like or dislike? What else would you change?</li>
					</ul>
